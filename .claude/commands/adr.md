Create a new Architecture Decision Record.

**Input**: a short title after `/adr` (e.g. `/adr use tokio for the async runtime`). If
omitted, infer it from the current conversation; if that is ambiguous, ask.

**Steps**

1. **Locate the ADR directory.** `docs/adr/`. If it does not exist yet, create it with a
   `0000-template.md` (copy an existing project template if one is around, otherwise write a
   minimal one: frontmatter `id`/`title`/`status`/`date`/`tags` plus Context, Decision,
   Options considered, Consequences sections) and a minimal `README.md` index table.

2. **Get the next number.** `ls` `docs/adr/`. Take the highest `NNNN` in a `*-*.md` filename
   (ignoring `0000-template.md`), add 1, zero-pad to 4 digits.

3. **Build the filename.** `<NNNN>-<title-kebab-cased>.md`. Lowercase, hyphens for spaces,
   strip punctuation.

4. **Write the file** from `docs/adr/0000-template.md`. Fill frontmatter:
   - `id`: `ADR-<NNNN>`
   - `title`: the title as given, sentence case
   - `status`: `proposed`
   - `date`: today (`date +%Y-%m-%d`)
   - `tags`: best guess from context, leave `[]` if unclear
   Leave the body sections as template prompts for the author to fill, but pre-fill Context
   from the conversation if there is enough signal.

5. **Add the index row.** Append a row to `docs/adr/README.md`:
   `| [NNNN](<filename>) | <title> | proposed | <one-line decision or —> | <date> |`
   Keep rows ordered by number.

6. **Report** the path and remind the author: fill the Options section including rejected
   options, and flip status to `accepted` once the decision survives contact with the code.

**Guardrails**
- Never reuse or guess a number without listing the directory first.
- Never write `status: accepted` on creation — new ADRs start `proposed`.
- Do not edit an existing `accepted` or `superseded` ADR. A changed decision is a new ADR that
  supersedes the old one.
